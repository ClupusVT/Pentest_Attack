To check the default user shell timeout on a Unix-like system, you can examine the configuration files related to session management. Here are some steps you can follow:

1. Open the terminal or SSH into the target system.
2. Check the value of the `TMOUT` environment variable by running the following command:
   ```bash
   echo $TMOUT
   ```
   If the output is `900` or a value less than 900, it indicates that the default user shell timeout is already set to 900 seconds or less.
3. If the `TMOUT` variable is not set or has a value greater than 900, you need to check the configuration files responsible for session management.
   - For the Bash shell, check the following files:
     - `/etc/profile`
     - `~/.bashrc`
     - `~/.bash_profile`
   - For the Zsh shell, check the following files:
     - `/etc/zsh/zshenv`
     - `~/.zshrc`
     - `~/.zshenv`
4. Open the relevant configuration file(s) using a text editor and search for lines that set the `TMOUT` variable or configure session timeout settings.
5. If you find any lines setting the `TMOUT` variable, ensure that the value is set to 900 or a value less than 900. If the variable is not set, you can add the following line to the configuration file(s) to set it:
   ```bash
   TMOUT=900
   ```
6. Save the changes to the configuration file(s) and exit the text editor.
7. To apply the changes, either restart the user's session or execute the configuration files manually using the `source` command. For example:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

After following these steps, the default user shell timeout should be set to 900 seconds or less. Remember to repeat the process for each user or the system-wide configuration files depending on your requirements.
