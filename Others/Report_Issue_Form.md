1. Cross Site Request Fogery (Medium)
```
Description:
	CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a type of web vulnerability that allows an attacker to make unauthorized requests to a web application on behalf of an authenticated user. This occurs when an attacker is able to trick a user into clicking a specially crafted link or visiting a website that contains malicious code.
Remediation:
•	Use of CSRF tokens: Web applications should use unique and unpredictable tokens to authenticate user requests, so that any unauthorized requests can be easily detected and rejected.
•	Strict origin policy: Web applications should use strict origin policies to ensure that requests are only accepted from trusted sources, and reject requests that originate from untrusted domains.
•	Use of HTTP-only cookies: Web applications should use HTTP-only cookies to prevent attackers from accessing or manipulating cookies using JavaScript code.
•	Regular updates and patches: Regularly updating and patching the operating system and any installed software can help prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited.
•	Use of security libraries: Web application developers can use security libraries, such as OWASP ESAPI or Spring Security, to help prevent CSRF attacks.

2. Reflected XSS
```
Description:
Reflected XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a type of web vulnerability where an attacker is able to inject malicious code into a web application, which is then reflected back to the user's browser in the form of an error message, search result, or other response.
The list of found Reflected XSS can be found in the details
	
Remediation:
•	Input validation: Web applications should validate user input to ensure that it does not contain any malicious code, such as JavaScript, HTML or other scripts that could be executed by a browser.
•	Output encoding: Before displaying user-generated content on a web page, web applications should encode the content to prevent browsers from executing any embedded scripts.
•	Content Security Policy (CSP): CSP allows web application developers to specify which sources are allowed to load content on their site, including scripts. By setting a strict CSP policy, web applications can limit the sources that can load their content, and help prevent XSS attacks.
```

3. Reflected XSS
```
Description:
	Most browsers have a facility to remember user credentials that are entered into HTML forms. This function can be configured by the user and also by applications that employ user credentials. If the function is enabled, then credentials entered by the user are stored on their local computer and retrieved by the browser on future visits to the same application.
	
Remediation:
	To prevent browsers from storing credentials entered into HTML forms, include the attribute autocomplete="off" within the FORM tag (to protect all form fields) or within the relevant INPUT tags (to protect specific individual fields).
```
4. Path Traversal
```
Description:
A path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. When using the “Download Health Report”
 feature, it is possible to change they key parameter to the desired system file to read.
Reference: https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_TraversalOWASP: OTG-CLIENT-007
Remediation:
•	The application should validate the user input before processing it. Ideally, the validation should compare against a whitelist of permitted values. If that isn't possible for the required functionality, then the validation should verify that the input contains only permitted content, such as purely alphanumeric characters.
•	After validating the supplied input, the application should append the input to the base directory and use a platform file system API to canonicalize the path. It should verify that the canonicalized path starts with the expected base directory.	
```
5. OS Command Injection
```
Description:
	Command injection is an attack in which the goal is the execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. By injecting a malicious payload into the file name when using the some implemented feature, it is possible to exploit the target system.

Remediation:
•	Validating against a whitelist of permitted values.
•	Validating that the input is a number.
•	Validating that the input contains only alphanumeric characters, no other syntax or whitespace.
```
6. Blind Command Injection
```
Description:
  Blind command injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application accepts user input and includes it in a system command without proper validation or sanitization. In a blind command injection scenario, the application does not provide any visible output or error messages that would indicate whether the injected command was successful or not.
	Many locations on the system allows this attack to happen.
Remediation:
•	Validating against a whitelist of permitted values.
•	Validating that the input is a number.
•	Validating that the input contains only alphanumeric characters, no other syntax or whitespace.
```
7. Backup files contain sensitive info
```
Description:
	During the penetration testing session, it was identified that backup files containing sensitive information such as contents of file /etc/config/shadow and /etc/config/passwd were accessible The presence of such files poses a significant security risk as they could be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, leading to potential breaches and compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the system
Remediation:
	Remove content of sensitive files in backup data
```
8. Strict transport security not enforced
```
Description:
	The application fails to prevent users from connecting to it over unencrypted connections. An attacker able to modify a legitimate user's network traffic could bypass the application's use of SSL/TLS encryption, and use the application as a platform for attacks against its users. This attack is performed by rewriting HTTPS links as HTTP, so that if a targeted user follows a link to the site from an HTTP page, their browser never attempts to use an encrypted connection.

Remediation:
	Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) by adding a response header with the name 'Strict-Transport-Security' and the value 'max-age=expireTime', where expireTime is the time in seconds that browsers should remember that the site should only be accessed using HTTPS. Consider adding the 'includeSubDomains' flag if appropriate.
